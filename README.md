# Unix-Stuff
Some simple programs written for my Unix programing class. Varying in difficulty from basics to System V IPC shared memory and socket based client - server comunications.
From lab7 programs are written in C, but are still using Unix based functions and are intended to use on such systems.
Some programs are using Solaris Based functions and do requier additional flags when compiling for example files in directory lab8: "kupuj5.c" and "kupuj6.c" require flag -lpthread, while :kupuj7.c" require -lsocket.
