# Unix-Stuff
Some simple programs written for my Unix programing class. Varying in difficulty from basics to System V IPC shared memory and socket based client - server comunications.

From lab7 programs are written in C, but are still using Unix based functions and are intended to use on such systems.

When compiling files in directory lab8: "kupuj5.c" and "kupuj6.c" they require flag -lpthread, while :kupuj7.c" in directiory lab9 require -lsocket.
